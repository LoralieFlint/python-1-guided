# Exercise 1
# Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator.

# How many seconds are there in 21 minutes and 15 seconds?
minutes = 21 * 60 + 15
print(minutes)

# How many miles are there in 5 kilometers?
miles = 0.62
kilometers = 5
print(kilometers * miles)

# If you run a 5 kilometer race in 21 minutes and 15 seconds, what is your average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)?
kilometers = 5
miles = 0.62
total_miles = kilometers * miles
minutes = 21 + .15
miles_per_minute = minutes / total_miles
print(miles_per_minute)

# What is your average speed in miles per hour?
kilometers = 5
miles = 0.62
total_miles = kilometers * miles
minutes = 21 + .15 * 60
miles_per_minute = minutes / total_miles
print(miles_per_minute)

# Suppose the cover price of a book is $19.95, but bookstores get a 25% discount. Shipping costs $2.50 for the first copy and $1 for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 75 copies?
cover = 19.95
discount = 0.25
shipping1 = 2.50
shipping2 = 1 * 74
print(cover * discount + shipping2 + shipping1)
